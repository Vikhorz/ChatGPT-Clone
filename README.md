## Features
- ChatGPT-like Interface: The web page offers a user-friendly and intuitive interface that closely resembles the ChatGPT experience. Users can engage in conversations with the chatbot and receive responses generated by the language model.

- Django Framework: The application is built on the Django framework, which provides a solid foundation for developing web applications with Python. Django's robust features, such as URL routing, views, models, and templates, are utilized to create a seamless user experience.

- OpenAI API Integration: The ChatGPT clone integrates with the OpenAI API, allowing it to harness the power of the language model to generate intelligent and context-aware responses. The OpenAI API handles natural language processing, enabling dynamic and engaging conversations with the chatbot.

## Usage
1- Registration: Users can create an account by providing their desired username, email address, and password. This step ensures a personalized experience and enables users to save their chat history or access additional features.

2- Chatting: Once registered and logged in, users can interact with the chatbot through the web page's interface. They can enter their messages, and the ChatGPT-based model will generate responses based on the input provided.

3- Responsive Design: The web page is designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and devices. Users can enjoy a consistent and visually appealing experience whether they are accessing the application from a desktop computer, tablet, or mobile phone.
